# Toggle Proportions
A tiny plugin for toggling the proportions constraint of a layer(s) in Sketch.
Just select your layer(s) and hit ```âŒ˜ ^ c``` (cmd + ctrl + C).

## How to Install
1. Download and open ```toggle-proportions-master.zip```
2. Open ```Toggle Proportions.sketchplugin``` (Sketch will automatically install the plugin)

## Notes
* Tested on Sketch 3.4
* Works with any layers except for text and slices
* For some reason Sketch doesn't change the lock icon unless you unselect and select the layer again... it's still working :)
